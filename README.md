# Slashdiablo

A mod pack for playing Diablo II on [Slashdiablo](https://slashdiablo.net/).

I took their [files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hLbrYs_U7eVcK-bWOom_Lr2_Y839AVba) and made modifications to use D2DX instead of D2HD as the video driver.

## Install

- Install the game
- Patch to [1.13c](http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/diablo2exp/patches/PC/LODPatch_113c.exe)
- Paste in the files
- Run with ``-3dfx``
